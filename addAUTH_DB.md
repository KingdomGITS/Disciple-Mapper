Title: Enhancing the Disciple Mapper Application with Authentication and Database Integration

Objective: The Disciple Mapper application currently operates by importing a CSV file, reading it line by line, and converting each line into various form elements such as text boxes, textareas, radio boxes, and checkboxes. The goal of this project is to enhance the application by adding user authentication and migrating the CSV data to a Supabase database.

Justification: The current CSV-based system lacks scalability and flexibility. By migrating to a database, we can ensure data consistency, improve performance, and provide a more robust and scalable solution. Adding authentication will enhance security by ensuring only authorized users can access and manipulate data.

Approach:

User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system using Supabase's authentication features. This will involve creating sign up, sign in, and log out functionalities.

Database Migration: Migrate the CSV data to a Supabase database. This will involve creating a matching table structure in Supabase and importing the CSV data.

Application Modification: Modify the application to fetch data from the Supabase database instead of the CSV file. This will involve changing the code that currently reads the CSV file to instead make API calls to Supabase.

Testing: Thoroughly test the new functionalities to ensure data integrity and correct operation.

Expected Benefits:

Scalability: A database system will allow the application to handle larger amounts of data more efficiently than a CSV file.

Security: User authentication will ensure that only authorized users can access the application.

Data Consistency: A database will help maintain data consistency and integrity.

Flexibility: With a database, it will be easier to add, remove, or modify data compared to a CSV file.

This project represents a significant enhancement of the Disciple Mapper application, making it more robust, secure, and capable of handling larger datasets.
